# Clojure (hearts) Kafka Streams

Clojure is a data-oriented langauge that runs on the JVM, the perfect companion for Streaming Compute with Kafka Streams.

This library is designed to demonstrate Kafka Streams with Clojure via the Kafka Streams Testing Framework.

No dependency on a running Kafka cluster, just run:

```bash
lein test
```

Or run the `troy-west.kstream.test` namespace within a REPL
