# Clojure (hearts) Kafka Streams

Clojure is a data-oriented langauge that runs on the JVM, a perfect companion for Streaming Compute with Kafka.

This library is designed to demonstrate Kafka Streams with Clojure via the Kafka Streams Testing Framework.

No dependency on a running Kafka cluster, just run:

```bash
lein test
```

Or run the `troy-west.kstream.examples` test namespace within a REPL

Curious to see what Clojure and Kafka Streams tests looking like? [Here are the goodies!](https://github.com/troy-west/kstream-examples/blob/master/test/troy_west/kstream/examples.clj)

We'll add examples to this library over time, you're welcome to contribute.
